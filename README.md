## CharacterSheet

# What is this? 
A full fledged D&D character sheet. It's not perfect, but it's mine (ours)!

# Why?
I don't use D&D Beyond because of it's restrictiveness, and I don't like how Ember's RPG Vault doesn't do certain things for you. 
Therefore, when I needed an idea for a final project for my Web Development class, I figured this would be the perfect thing to work on! We learned Angular with the Google Firebase/Cloud Firestore framework, which we used for user data storage and authentication.

# Release
The latest production release of the character sheet can be found at https://character-sheet-d0d6d.web.app/

# Notes and Features
You can look up spells when adding them through the D&D 5e SRD API via their name. It will auto-format input text to the format the API likes.

The actions component is still a bit buggy and the "To hit" modifiers are usually wrong.

The "Trackables" component can be used to track status effects as well as spell slots/exhaustion levels...
