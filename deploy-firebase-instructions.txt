Deploy your app to Firestore Hosting this way:

1. (You've already created an account online in firestore.)
2. Install the firebase-tools package.
3. On the CLI, log in to firebase with firebase login.
4. Build your app with ng build --prod
5. In the root of your application directory, do firebase init
6. Use arrow keys, spacebar, and enter to choose "Hosting".
7. Use dist/<yourappname> as the "public" directory  (I went looking for the name of this directory before I started.)
8. Choose to configure as a single-page application.
    Do NOT overwrite the index.html.
9. Run firebase deploy. The URL for your deployed app will be given at the end.

Note: after the first deploy and you want to make changes, you just need to do step 4 and step 6.
